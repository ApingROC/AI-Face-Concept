I would like to introduce a concept that aims to revolutionize how we interact with AI by integrating human facial expressions into their design.

Currently, there are two primary approaches to creating AI faces:
	1.	Flat Screens: Simple, literal flat displays for expressions.
	2.	Full-Fledged Human Models: Complex human-like heads with elastic skin, detailed eyes, teeth, and mouths. These rely on intricate arrangements of actuators to mimic facial expressions.

While the latter creates a more realistic appearance, the resulting motions often feel unsettling—what many call the “uncanny valley” effect, where the human brain perceives them as alien and unnatural.

A New Approach

Thanks to recent advancements in flexible OLED screens and transparent OLED screens, there is now an opportunity to create AI faces that are:
	•	Visually appealing: Human-like enough to feel relatable.
	•	Distinctively robotic: Clearly identifiable as AI, avoiding the uncanny valley effect.

By layering transparent and flexible OLED screens on a genuine 3D head model (e.g., three screen layers), we could create a semi-holographic impression. This would give the appearance of depth and dynamic movement—like the mesmerizing “endless mirror effect.” The result would be an AI face that is “just good enough” to be relatable while embracing its robotic identity.
